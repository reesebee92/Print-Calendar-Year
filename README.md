# Print-Calendar-Year

This project called for a program to print out a calendar year month given the user prompt for a month number 
between 1-12 and a calendar year. Once the user input is received the calendar for that particular month and
year is displayed. The second part of the project will display a full calendar year given the user input for
a particular year.

The purpose of this project is to display our knowledge thus far concerning methods and the ease of reusing them.
